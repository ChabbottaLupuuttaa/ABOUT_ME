          <p>Fueled by a passion for crafting user-friendly digital experiences that empower everyone, I'm a third-year computer science 
		  student excitedly exploring the realm of web design. Obsessed with user-centered design and building beautiful, accessible systems, 
		  I'm driven to break down barriers and make the web a welcoming place for all.</p>
         
		 <h3><span style="font-size: 4.5em;"><i>E</i></span>arly Beginnings </h3>
          <p>Arriving prematurely at seven months, my arrival was deemed a fortunate event. The name "Chabota" means "good" in Tonga, a 
		  fitting tribute to my early entrance into the world. Growing up in vibrant, sun-soaked Livingstone, where even the sunsets blaze with
		  optimism, instilled in me an unwavering resilience and a deep love for warm hues, both of which I now pour into my design work.
		  </p>
          <p>After completing primary and secondary school in Southern Province, I yearned to travel to a distant place. The Copperbelt, with
		  its promise of new experiences and challenges, called to me. And as they say, everything works out in time.</p>
          <p>If I could meet my fifteen-year-old self, I'd offer one piece of advice, borrowed from one of my favorite poets, Oscar Wilde: 
		  "Be yourself, because everyone else is taken." I'd also urge him to pick up some literature and discover the magic of storytelling.

		   <h3><span style="font-size: 4.5em;"><i>D</i></span>reams & Ambitions </h3>
          <p>My dreams stretch far and wide, but one vision burns brightest: a future where technology empowers, not divides. 
		  Imagine a world where everyone, regardless of ability, can navigate the web with ease and unlock its endless possibilities.
		  That's the world I'm striving to build, one inclusive design at a time. Through honed skills in web development, accessibility, and UX design,
		  I'm ready to bridge the digital gap and make the web a brighter, more inclusive space for everyone.
